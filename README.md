Greetings!

Figli book api uses Google-books API (https://developers.google.com/books?hl=ru) to provide acces for the most popular books library. 
Authorization was provided by Firebase, so you can freely register and search for any interested book you want. Also you can stash your favorite book in your bookshelf.

Project was started from simple CRA. For good user experience I used react-spinner and react-tastify so any problems would be shown in UI.

For styling I used Materialize.

Global state management was provided by React-redux.
